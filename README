This is a webscraper to fetch and watch flight ticket prices move during a period of time 

needed:
a get Data Function
a put Data in CSV Function
a Variable: Timeout for waiting between the fetches 
Some kind of output/Log what the programm is doing right now and when it'll fetch Data again.

Then I can just do the whole program like this:
getData() "Price right now is..." "Already passed to {Dateiname}.csv
Next fetch in XY Minutes @13:23"...

I should also consider using a VPN or a Proxy that is rotating IP adresses
Bet there's a plugin for that...
